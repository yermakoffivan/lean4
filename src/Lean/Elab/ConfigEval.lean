# Configuration evaluation

This module is responsible for efficiently elaborating and evaluating syntax
used to configure tactics, commands, and term elaborators.

Users should import this module to ensure they have all the elaborators and
instances available.

The main interface are the `declare_core_config_elab`, `declare_term_config_elab`,
`declare_config_elab` and `declare_command_config_elab` commands, however the
system is designed to be flexible to support custom configurations.

These support user-defined configuration syntaxes without declaring them to the system.
See `Lean.Elab.ConfigEval.foldConfigM` for a specification of what is allowed.
