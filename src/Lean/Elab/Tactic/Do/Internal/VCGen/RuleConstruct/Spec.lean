Create the proof term for the backward rule built from an instantiated spec theorem.
In order for the backward rule to apply, the concrete precondition, postcondition and exception
postcondition appearing in the spec may need to be generalized into rule parameters, emitting
verification conditions for the generalization.

### General idea

Consider the spec theorem `WPMonad.wp_bind`:
```
WPMonad.wp_bind :
  wp x (fun a => wp (f a) post epost) epost ⊑ wp (x >>= f) post epost
```
This theorem is already in WP-form, so `post` and `epost` are schematic. However, its precondition
`wp x (fun a => wp (f a) post epost) epost` is not. Hence we must emit a VC for the precondition:
```
prf : ∀ {α β} (x : m α) (f : α → m β) (post : β → Pred) (epost : EPred)
  (pre : Pred) (hpre : pre ⊑ wp x (fun a => wp (f a) post epost) epost),
  pre ⊑ wp (x >>= f) post epost
```
The proof term is constructed with `PartialOrder.rel_trans hpre WPMonad.wp_bind`.

#### Postcondition VCs

Similarly, a VC is generated for the postcondition if it is not schematic. For example, a
hypothetical restrictive spec for `pure` could be:
```
myPure.spec (n : Nat) : (⊤ : Prop) ⊑ wp (myPure n) (fun r => r = n) epost
```
This yields a backward rule of the form:
```
prf : ∀ (n : Nat) (pre : Prop) (hpre : pre ⊑ True)
  (post : Nat → Prop) (hpost : ∀ r, r = n ⊑ post r) (epost : EPost⟨⟩),
  pre ⊑ wp (myPure n) post epost
```
The postcondition VC is pointwise over the return value and over any excess state arguments. The
proof is generalized with `WPMonad.wp_consequence_rel`.

#### Exception postcondition VCs

A VC is also generated for the exception postcondition if it is not schematic. For an `EPost.cons`
value, the relation `epostSpec ⊑ epost` is decomposed component by component:
```
∀ e s₁ ... sₙ, epostSpec.head e s₁ ... sₙ ⊑ epost.head e s₁ ... sₙ
```
and recursively for the tail. `decomposeEPostRel` assembles these component VCs using
`EPost.cons_rel` and `EPost.nil_rel`; the proof is then generalized with `WPMonad.wp_econs_rel`.
When the spec exception postcondition is `⊥` (or of type `EPost.nil`), no VC is needed and
`WPMonad.wp_econs_bot_rel` (or `WPMonad.wp_econs_nil_rel`) is used instead.

#### Excess state arguments

Furthermore, when there are excess state arguments `[s₁, ..., sₙ]` involved, the proof is
specialized to those arguments:
```
... :
  pre ⊑ wp x (fun a => wp (f a) post epost) epost s₁ ... sₙ →
  pre ⊑ wp (x >>= f) post epost s₁ ... sₙ
```
The precondition and all generated pointwise postcondition premises are applied to these same state
arguments.

### Caching

It turns out we can cache backward rules for the cache key
`(specThm.proof.key, instWP, excessArgs.size)`. This is important for performance and helps avoid
rebuilding the same rule for every goal that uses the same spec theorem, `WPMonad` instance and
number of excess state arguments. We do that in the `VCGenM` wrapper
`mkBackwardRuleFromSpecCached`.

The rule is built from the abstracted proof returned here via `mkBackwardRuleFromExpr`. This keeps
the proof construction reusable even when the proof still contains free variables from the goal
context, such as generic monad or WP instance parameters.

### Specialization and unfolding of `Std.Internal.Do` abbreviations and defs

It is unnecessary to use the `bind` rule in full generality. It is much more efficient to specialize
it for the particular predicate type, exception postcondition type and `WPMonad` instance.
`tryMkBackwardRuleFromSpec` does that by instantiating the spec theorem and checking that its
`Pred` and `WPMonad` arguments match the ones from the use site.

For `StateM Nat` and one excess state arg `s`, the type produced for `WPMonad.wp_bind` becomes
```
prf : ∀ (pre : Prop) (α : Type) (x : StateT Nat Id α) (β : Type)
  (f : α → StateT Nat Id β) (post : β → Nat → Prop) (epost : EPost⟨⟩) (s : Nat),
  pre ⊑ wp x (fun a => wp (f a) post epost) epost s →
  pre ⊑ wp (x >>= f) post epost s
```

This construction works with the explicit `wp` application obtained from the instantiated theorem.
`tryMkBackwardRuleFromSpec` extracts the program and concrete postconditions from that application
before calling `mkSpecBackwardProof`; this helper does not inspect the full `wp` term itself. At the
moment it does not perform additional `unfoldReducible` preprocessing on the forall telescope; any
unfolding of `Std.Do` abbreviations and reducible definitions has to happen before or around this
construction step.

The result stays in `⊑` form. After the generated metavariables are abstracted, the returned proof
has the shape expected by `mkBackwardRuleFromExpr`.

       defeq, but unfolding the function-lattice `⊑` instance is blocked when the post's domain is a
       metavariable (e.g. the accumulator `β` of a `forIn` loop spec). Cast `hpost` to the function

Given a spec `pre ⊑ wp prog post epost` where the lattice type is
`info.Pred = σ1 → ... → σn → Prop`, produces an auxiliary lemma.

- `info.Pred`: the goal's lattice type (e.g. `Nat → Prop`)
- `info.instWP`: the `WPMonad` instance for the goal monad
- `info.excessArgs`: free variables representing state args from
  `info.Pred = σ1 → ... → σn → Prop`
