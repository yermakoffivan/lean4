/-!
Same benchmark as `vcgen_add_sub_cancel` but using a deep transformer stack.

abbrev M := ExceptT String <| ReaderT String <| ExceptT Nat <| StateT Nat <| ExceptT Unit <| StateM Unit

Known issues:
* Using `StateT String` instead of `ReaderT String` picks the wrong spec for `MonadStateOf.get`; namely that on `String`.
  It seems we need to disambiguate discrimination tree lookup results with defeq.
* Even using `ReaderT String` it doesn't work. TODO: Why?
* But just using `ExceptT String` works.
