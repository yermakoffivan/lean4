/-- A no-op computation used as a verification gadget to inject assertions into the program.

The `name` parameter is used by VCGen to name the introduced hypothesis. The `as` parameter
is the assertion to be checked. At runtime, `assertGadget` is simply `pure ⟨⟩`. -/

/-- Specification for `assertGadget`: the precondition requires both the assertion `as` and
the Heyting implication `as ⇨ post ⟨⟩`, ensuring the assertion holds and the postcondition
follows from it. -/
